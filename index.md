<h1> About Me </h1>

Hey there! My name is Shivani Karingula and I am an aspiring data scientist. As someone who has always been an inquisitive person, data science is a field that immediately caught my attention. It's something that not only allows me to use my analytical skills to answer questions and solve problems but it also gives me a chance to put my creativity and love for storytelling to use via data visualization. 

As for my background, I have a double-major Bachelor's degree from Rutgers Business School in Business Analytics & Information Technology as well as Supply Chain Management. During my time in undergrad, I completed two 1-year co-ops with leading multi-national companies in the field of supply chain and analytics. For my first co-op, I worked in the transportation department of Supply Chain at Shiseido, the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world. Later, I worked at Ethicon (Johnson & Johnson's medical devices company) as a Supply Chain Analytics Co-op where I spearheaded report automation projects utilizing Tableau and Python which resulted signifiant savings for the organization. 

Post graduating from Rutgers, I switched gears and worked as an Implementation Consultant in the healthcare sector at Medidata Inc. After gaining valauble skills here, I decided it was time for me to make a career shift that aligns more with my interest in developing my technical knowledge, which is when I decided to pursue the Data Science Master's Certification Program with Simplilearn. 

Now that you know a little more about me and how I got to where I am right now, feel free take a look at the projects I've worked on:
